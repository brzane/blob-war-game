# BlobWar Game with AI Algorithms
## Overview:
This Project is built with passion to learn how computers can play against us in simple video game called blob War which uses Two player game concept 
you can try it out from this link https://www.twoplayergames.org/game/blob-wars
## What this Project contains:
 1- CLI representation of the gamePlay (Hap
 2- You can choose between two AI Algorithms so the computer can apply in the game
    #### MinMax Algorithm:
          is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case  (maximum loss) scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"â€”to maximize the minimum gain. Originally formulated for n-player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision-making in the presence of uncertainty.
